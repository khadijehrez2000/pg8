       <h3> Connecting Afghanistan to the World</h3>
Kam Air is the first Afghan private commercial airline and is owned by its founder, Mr. Zamaray Kamgar, the eminent Afghan businessman. Kam Air is the only airline in Afghanistan that is an active member of IATA Geneva with a 5 STAR safety rating which was accomplished by successfully passing internationally recognized audit conducted by IATA Geneva called IOSA (The IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) Program is an internationally recognized and accepted evaluation system designed to assess the operational management and control systems of an airline: IATA WEBISTE). This audit is mandatory for all IATA members and airlines. With this certificate an airline is 4 times safer with high operation control than have those who don’t have it. Kam Air is credited to be the only private airline in Afghanistan to have operated to maximum number of destinations domestically and internationally. Since its establishment, the airline has enjoyed impressive growth and has not looked back since. Kam Air is a major contributor in the development of Kabul as a vital air corridor in the region, supporting commercial, industrial, and tourism sectors of the landlocked country.

              <h3>  Historic Achievement</h3> 
During the years 2020/2021 when the pandemic hit every airline in the world, Kam Air was the only airline from Afghanistan that was transporting humanitarian aid and medicines to different corners of the world. One of our proudest moments was when we set the record for the longest flight in Afghanistan's aviation history, which was from Nanjing, China, to Santiago, Chile. The flight landed in Chile after 28 hours of journey, carrying a large amount of medical equipment. Kam Air is the only airline from Afghanistan that operated the first ever all-female crew flight with two female pilots accompanied by four women cabin crew, which flew a Boeing 737-500 airplane from Kabul to Herat.
